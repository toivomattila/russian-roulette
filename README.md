## Game Mechanics

### Rules
- The game simulates a six-chamber revolver with one bullet
- Each trigger pull rotates the chamber to the next position
- Surviving a shot means the current chamber was empty
- Hitting the loaded chamber ends the game

### Probabilities
- Initial shot: 5/6 chance of survival (83.33%)
- Second shot: 4/5 chance (80%)
- Third shot: 3/4 chance (75%)
- Fourth shot: 2/3 chance (66.67%)
- Fifth shot: 1/2 chance (50%)
- Final shot: 0% chance of survival

### Strategy
Consider restarting the game after surviving a few shots to maintain better odds of survival. The probability of survival decreases with each shot.
